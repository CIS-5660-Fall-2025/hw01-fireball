# [Project 1: Noise](https://github.com/CIS-566-Fall-2022/hw01-fireball-base)

## Description

The scene is generated based upon three shaders, and a couple of icospheres.

For the fireball, we rendered an icosphere on the inside, acting as the "comet" or the "meteor of the subject. The second icosphere acted as the flame, which included a displacement weighted by sinusoidal functions for the tail. The transparency of the tail also grew smaller as it moved away from the surface linearly; the transparency is also affected by a fractal brownian motion noise generating function as well. There are also two smaller icospheres that are used in the flame as well, to add a bit of extra volume in its shape. Lastly, an icosphere with a large radius is used for the background - the radius is large enough so that zooming out of the scene would cause little to know effect in its parallax. 

The five toolbox functions used in this project are:
- sine and cosine functions (to vary the colors slightly over time, and to perturb the shape of the flame at lower frequencies)
- impulse function (to create a smooth gradient of colors for the inner icosphere, where the bottom part is brighter than the top part)
- sawtooth wave (for blah) (for the alpha of the inner icosphere over time)
- ease in and out quadratics (brighter in the center, less bright further back for the flame)
- smoother step function (when changing the length of the tail, we want to stretch the tail of the flame but not the main "bulb" of the flame itself. This function helps us to weight the influence of that stretching to only the tail and not the "bulb")

The noise function used is fractal brownian motion

The three GUI features implemented are:
- changing the color of the flame

- change the frame rate of the flame's motion (see weblink and play around)
- change the tail length of the flame

The "extra spice" feature used in this project is:
- Adding a background! This is performed by creating an icosphere with a radius of 500 - large enough so that the parallax effects are minimal when panning around the screen. The stars in the background are generated by inputting the fractal brownian motion in the fragment shader, and rendering white pixels for fbm(position) > 0.48, and nothing if <.
