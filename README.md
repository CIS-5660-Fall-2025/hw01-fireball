# Fireball 🕺🔥

Fireball is a WebGL2/TypeScript demo that renders a stylized, multi-pass fireball (core, flames, glow) that reacts in real time to music. Turn on Fireball mode to place Pitbull’s “Fireball” video behind a transparent canvas and drive the shader via tab-audio; when tab capture isn’t supported, it falls back to microphone or a local audio file. The audio pipeline computes bass/mid/treble energy and a beat pulse (with envelopes/AGC) so flame height, glow, exposure, and grain respond clearly to the track. Use the built-in GUI to tweak look, geometry, and audio mappings, and orbit the camera with mouse drag/scroll. Works best in Chrome; Safari/Firefox use the mic/file fallback.
